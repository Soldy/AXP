The AXP (Application eXtreme Properties) format is a simple application description format. One JSON file describes a full application.

This format can create a webpage, desktop, and mobile app with limitations. Can not build webshops or games. 

AXP focuses on analytics, data editing, and data visualization.  Help the system to represent information that is not effective with words. 

But too big to put on an Excel table. 

The original main goal was to understand the Deep  Learning result.


How it works?


The system has 4 modules: 2 sides, and 2 layers.

The sides are front-end and back-end. They are separate MVC-like systems.  Both can work in standalone,  p2p, or swarm mode. 

The 2 layers: are the data transfer protocol and, the data storage layer.

 1 on the front side, 2 on the backend side. All modules have submodules. 

 At the moment the front end uses the hell tool. Far from optimal because that was built for the 13k games challenge. But it was a fast and time-effective solution.  Logical if I do not affect any tool that I used in the past or any of my contracts, and probably never use it in my work. Sorry for that.


 Data format:

 Mayor data structure. Every element has 2 different IDs. One is the serial ID that is used inside the module and the uniqeId is the same on every module. 


 Code overwrite:

 Every provided function and class can be overridden. But has some temporary rules. This rule should be changed in the future. The reverse keywords are expectations from these rules.

 -The code override is driven by the variable or the function's first character. You cannot override anything that ends with``` _```. The function that started with ```_``` should be overridden only at a higher level.
 -The functions/classes name words are separated with upper case. ```ThisIsAClass``` ```thisIsAFunction```.
 -The variable name snakifid. ```this_is_a_variable```.
 -Functions that started with Upper case should be managed as a class. 
 -Only class names can start with upper case. NOTHING ELSE CAN START WITH UPPER CASE. In theory, the builder recognizes your mistake. However, that has no guarantee.
